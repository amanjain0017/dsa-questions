No, you cannot reverse a linked list in less than O(N) time complexity, where N is the number of nodes in the linked list. Reversing a linked list requires visiting each node and changing the pointers to reverse the order of the elements. Since you have to process each node once, the time complexity of reversing a linked list is inherently O(N).

Any algorithm that claims to reverse a linked list in less than O(N) time complexity is likely incorrect or based on a misunderstanding of the problem. Therefore, O(N) is the optimal time complexity for reversing a linked list.
